                    Japan is a small island nation in East Asia, yet its global presence is substantial. 
                    It boasts the fourth-largest economy and the second-largest research and development 
                    budget in the world, continuously driving innovation in fields such as robotics, automation, 
                    and space exploration. Japan has cemented itself as a top asset in the global economy, 
                    serving as a major exporter of automobiles, consumer electronics, and visual media to 
                    Western markets. This has reinforced its image as a high-tech glamorious nation.

                To gain a deeper understanding of Japan, I traveled there to explore its infrastructure from an anthropological perspective 
                and uncover the reality behind its Western perception. With most countries, their perception from foreigners is heavily dictated 
                by their major cities, and Japan is no different. Tokyo and Osaka are the top two major cities in Japan — the Greater Tokyo Area being the largest 
                metropolitan area in the world. It is no surpise that many foreigners perceive Japan with a cyberpunk aesthetic with some of the largest tourist 
                attractions looking like these:

                For the most part, based on my experience, Japan does live up to its glamorous portrayal. I visited several of these iconic destinations, starting with Akihabara in Tokyo. Known as Tokyo's "Electric Town," Akihabara is home to a vast array of stores, many reflecting the area's electronics, anime, and gaming culture. From multi-story shops filled with the latest technology to retro arcades, maid cafés, and anime stores, it perfectly embodies the vibrant image of Japan that many foreigners expect.

                The next area I visited was Ginza in Tokyo, one of the city's most famous and upscale neighborhoods. While it has fewer flashy signs compared to Akihabara and other parts of Tokyo, the hundreds of designer stores, spotless streets, and tall buildings reinforce the Western perception of Japan as a high-tech, glamorous nation. I visited popular attractions like the 12-story Uniqlo and the Wako Store in Ginza, but even just strolling through the area, you come across some truly amazing sights like these:

                I also visited Shibuya, one of Tokyo's busiest districts, with the iconic Shibuya Crossing offering a perfect example of the area's energy and atmosphere. Shibuya Station, which is one of the busiest stations in all of Japan, houses an impressive piece of technology, though I didn't get to see it, is the piezoelectric energy-generating floor tiles. Like Akihabara, Shibuya exudes glamour with its bright neon signs, spotless streets, and a large variety of shops.

                The other face of Japan is found in its preservered history. The ancient temples, historic castles, and traditional gardens are all testaments to a history rich in tradition, 
                and contribute significantly to Japan's identity. In fact, some of Japan's more popular tourist attractions are these historic landmarks, making it a significant contributor
                to foreigners perception of the nation.

                One thing you'll quickly notice about Japan is its deep-rooted farming culture. While the country is often recognized for its bustling cities and historic landmarks, agriculture has been the foundation of its infrastructure for thousands of years—a legacy that continues today. Just a short commute from the busiest streets of Tokyo or Osaka, or a few minutes from some of the world's oldest and largest temples, you'll find farmland. From small household gardens growing fresh vegetables to expansive rice paddies stretching across the countryside, agriculture remains an integral part of Japan's landscape and identity.

                    In order to examine this culture further, I spent a week in Hamamatsu which is the city where my Mother is from. I stayed with my Aunt, and we explored places of
                    agricultural significance. To start, I went to my Grandmother's house to celebrate the new year. On this property, you will find a third of it taken by gardening space
                    where radishes and other vegetables are grown. The yield from these small plots would help feed the family, and the surplus would be sold on a shelf on the street (which
                    is completed based on the honor system).

                The Hamamatsu area is also home to hundreds of greenhouses that allow crops to be grown year-round. The region's ideal climate—plenty of sunshine and little rainfall—makes it well-suited for this type of agriculture. These greenhouses cultivate a wide variety of crops, and during our visit, we even came across an unagi (eel) farm. However, the plastic covering was coated in algae, preventing us from seeing inside, but we were able to peak into an empty one which is shown below.

                    Japan is located on the "Ring of Fire," making it a mountainous region prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. As a result, only 11.5% of the country's land is suitable for growing crops. This partially explains the large number of small plots in suburban and rural areas, but Japan has also implemented other innovative farming methods, such as terrace farming which terraforms mountainous regions into farmable land. Such innovations have contributed to some of the highest crop yields per unit area in the world.

                To dive deeper into Japan's agricultural identity, I spent a week with a family of five on a property in Morimachi. During my stay, I helped with various chores, like feeding chickens, collecting leaves and making compost, cutting wood, excavating the land, harvesting bamboo, and picking radishes. The family makes the most of their large property, using the bamboo for building gardening patches, clothes hangers, and even creating a nagashi somen setup for the kids. The chickens are fed tofu byproducts and food scraps, and their eggs are used for meals. In the backyard, they grow shiitake mushrooms on logs and gather firewood from the property to heat the house. This experience highlighted the resourcefulness I often see in Japanese culture.

                On the surface, Japan has two distinct sides: one is its long and complex history, preserved in Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples, and historic monuments; the other is its high-tech, cyberpunk-inspired society, with cutting-edge infrastructure, neon-lit skylines, and an optimal transportation system.  This is how many foreigners perceive Japan, and rightfully so, as these are the glamorous tourist attractions that people travel across the world for. However, the true foundation of Japanese identity lies in its agriculture. Beyond shaping the traditional diet, agriculture reflects the country's deep connection to nature and its traditions. Many Japanese people believe that humans live amongst nature and not above it, and this perspective fosters the culture of respect that Japan is known for. Additionally, agriculture mirrors the simplicity valued by many in Japan. It requires consistency and patience, qualities that are deeply reflected in Japan's work culture. Although some may consider it toxic, the Japanese workforce is known for its tireless and consistent effort in the work they accomplish. In short, Japanese agriculture is as integral to the culture as its world heritage sites and bustling cities, embodying the country's customs, beliefs, and way of life.
