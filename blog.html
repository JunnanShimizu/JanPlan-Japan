                <li>I woke up around 7:00 AM and ate a similar breakfast of white bread. This time we put Japanese mayo and cheese on one of them. I ate this alongside a hardboiled egg and some black tea.</li>
                <li>A bit after 11:00, I had a train to catch to the Tokyo Station.</li>

                    We also visited my Grandma's house to pick some radishes for tomorrow's New Years celebration.

                    This morning, I woke up at 5:30 AM to watch the first sunrise of 2025. We walked to the beach to see it.

                <li>Then, we returned home to eat mochi and ozoni which is a traditional Japanese soup eaten on New Years.</li>
                <li>
                    Next, we walked over to my grandmother's house to say hi to her and my other Aunt.

                    My grandma seemed very happy and excited to see me even though she has trouble remember who I was. She has lots of joy and it was very heartwarming!
                </li>
                <li>Most of this day was free time. For lunch I ate instant ramen which had meat sealed inside.</li>

                    Before dinner, my cousin and I went to see the sunset at the beach. Also took one of my favorite pictures.

                <li>Today, we went to my Uncle's mother's grave in the mountains.</li>
                <li>
                    After, we went to the rice fields in the mountains. It required a bit of a hike, but it was super cool to see.

                    Because Japan's geographical area is small with many mountaineous regions, rice farms like these were built to maintain the supply and demand of rice in Japan. 
                    Unfortunately, the farming industry in Japan is having trouble replacing the current workforce.
                    There was also a TV show recorded about here.
                    This is 1/100 mountaineous rice fields (I still need to translate these).

                    Today, I went mochi making with a couple of families in Hamamatsu. There were a bunch of kids and their parents. This involved pounding the rice.

                    We started the day by visiting some greenhouses in the Hamamatsu area, some of regular produce and of an unagi (eel) farm.

                    We also saw a vending machine for produce which is relatively common. Usually, produce is left out on shelves with a price tag, but in this case, it was a vending machine of sorts.

                    Here is the inside of the unagi farm. The running eel farms were impossible to inside of because the plastic was covered in algae.

                    Next, we went to a famous cave. This was more for fun than anything.

                    Afterwards, we went to a rest stop right near the water. I got gyoza and curry there.

                    Today, I had breakfast and lunch at my Aunt's house and left for the farm in Morimachi. We arrived around 2:00PM and we were given a tour of the property. There is a large hill/mountain behind the house and we walked along the trail. There was bamboo and trees that were not naturally there.

                    Here, the family consists of two parents and three children of ages 6, 5, and 3. I played with them until dinner time. We ate curry.

                <li>Today, I woke up early at around 5:50 to eat breakfast. The kids ate as well and left for school around 7 / 7:30.</li>
                <li>
                    I spent almost the entire morning raking and collecting leaves in the backyard that would be used for fertilizer/compost.

                    It did start to rain, however, so in the meantime, I installed a vinyl backsplash to their kitchen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a quick lunch, I went back outside to get started with the compost process. With the pile of leaves I collected (and other roots, grass, nuts, etc.), I had a process of compacting the pile, adding the crushed soybeans, and adding grass/dirt on top and repeating until the bag of crushed soybeans was empty.

                    I found this large larvae in the grass/dirt which I assume helps decompose the leaves.

                    I also split some logs for the fire stove inside to keep the house warm.

                    After I went to the mall while the mom went to the gym.

                <li>
                    My first task of the day was to make spheres out of strips of bamboo to make bundles of pine. From my understanding, these are used to make sake.

                    Next, I dug out a trench on the hill next to the house to help with water runoff since there tended to be a muddy spot.

                    Next, I had to put new paper on the sliding doors. This was a tough task because the paper wanted to roll and the glue was not very sticky. I did not do a great job, but it gets the job done. This took multiple hours, unfortunately.

                    One of the more heavy workload days today. Since Yoko-san was not working at home like she usually does, this was the to-do list I was given.

                    All the work was not very glamorous, so I did not take many pictures; However, I did come across one of the biggest and scariest-looking spiders I had ever seen.

                    According to Reddit, this is a Joro Spider (Trichonephila clavata) and is completely harmless.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, while I was cutting wood, I came across these spiders as well. Also big and scary.

                    According to Reddit, these are Huntsman Spiders. They are venemous, but apparently not dangerous to humans.

                <li>After my chores, I went to 7Eleven for snacks.</li>

                    After breakfast, my first task of the day was to break down these two old garden boxes made of bamboo that were deteriorating.

                    Here at the house, they grow Shiitake Mushrooms!

                    </div>
                    I had to move the logs to a different spot from their backyard to the left of their house.

                <li>
                    Next, I went to harvest some radishes which is about a 5 minute walk away from the house. I picked 11, 10 for my next task, and one for dinner.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Once, I got back to the house with the radishes, I cut the leaves off which can be eaten and/or fed to the chickens. Then, I washed the radishes to hang them to make takuwan (pickled daikon radish) as seen in the pictures. This is done by first drying the radishes for 1-3 weeks and then prepping with salts and such.
                    <div>

                    The hanging process was not easy -- in fact, I dropped one and it split in half. 
                </li>
                <li>Next, I did a couple of chores with Yoko-san. First, we went to a tofu making place. Because it was garbage day, all the crushed soybeans that were used to make tofu are left out to be thrown out. This family goes to this tofu making place to collect their scraps (with their permission). These scraps are just soybeans, so they can be eaten; however, we use this as part of the chicken feed which is a mix of this and seeds. Yoko-san was also telling me that they go to sushi and fish prepping places for scraps which also make great feed for the chickens.</li>
                <li>
                    Next, we went to a couple more stores to pick up some things for dinner. This place specifically stood out to me because it is a market where all the goods are local and made and sold by farmers in the area.

                <li>
                    Because we were out, we weant to a Ramen place for lunch.

                <li>
                    Once we were back, we went straight back to work. We first went over the hill that surrounds the house to access some bamboo. Here we collected two large stalks of bamboo, cut off the branches, and carried them back to the house.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The purpose of this bamboo is to remake the clothes hangers outside because it was rotting. This is what I want to make, but slightly smaller.

                    To make this, I cut the bamboo into 6 even pieces, and used the old string used for the previous one (and braided the fraying ends) and tied them together. The last picture is the finished product.

                <li>
                    Gin-chan and Yu-chan asked this morning for me to be there to pick them up from preschool/daycare, so I went. The place was very cute. They have a showcase for the day's lunch which I thought was cool

                <li>Today was not super eventful. Because I was left alone on the property again today, I was given a list of tasks to do. My first task was to dig the moat a bit further, about 10 more feet.</li>
                <li>There is also a dirt ramp that the kids like to slide down, and I extended it by removing roots, branches, and plants that were above it on the hill.</li>
                <li>
                    After this, I trimmed some of the bushes around the property. Subtle, but enough I think.

                <li>
                    Lastly, I did my other everday chores like put the laundry away, feed the chickens, and collect the eggs. Here is a picture of the food I give the chickens. It is a mixtureof the tofu soybean scraps and seeds.

                <li>Today I woke up a little after 6:00 to eat breakfast. Today we ate omurice which Gin-chan requested the day before.</li>
                <li>
                    After lounging for a bit and packing a little, Yoko-san, the kids, and I went to the library to return and borrow some books.
                    <div>

                <li>
                    Once we returned, we had to prepare for our very fun and creative lunch. First we had to get a large stalk of bamboo. The bamboo grows over and past the hill that the house is next to, so I had to carry this heavy stalk fairly far. Cutting it down was also very difficult. 
                    <div>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, we got a hammer and a crowbar to split it in half. This, again, was very difficult.
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    And then, I used a chisel and hammer to clear out the parts on the inside.

                </li>
                <li>
                    With the clothes hanger posts I made a couple days ago and the split bamboo, we made nagashi somen!
                    <div>

                    It was A LOT of work to do this and we ended up eating relatively late, but it was fun in the end and the somen was very good. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The kids were also making bow and arrows after lunch with the spare bamboo.

                    Hiromi-chan came and picked me up around 2:00. I said my goodbyes to everyone, and left at around 3:00. We had reservations at 5:30 at a Tonkatsu Restaurant in Hamamatsu that my family really likes. The place had the robots that carry the food around too which was cool. 
                    <div>

                    This place was delicious, and it came with unlimited rice, miso soup, and cabbage (which is expensive in Japan right now apparently because of the heat last summer). There was also two types of tonkatsu that use different cuts of pork, so we split half of each.
               </li>
               <li>Once we returned back to the house, I took a warm bath.</li>

                    Today I left at around 8:45 to catch my train from Hamamatsu to Kyoto where I would meet my Dad. On my way to the train station, my Aunt and I stopped at an egg vending machine.

                    On my way to Kyoto, I started seeing some snow.

                <li>Once I got to Kyoto station, our plan was to meet up at the clock right outside the station. While I was waiting for my Dad, I talked to a stranger and ending up giving him 500 yen because he needed money to get home.</li>
                <li>
                    Once I met up with my Dad, we went to the hotel to drop off our luggage. Our first destination of the trip was Kiyomizu Temple. I have my professional camera out with this entire time, so you'll see an upgrade in picture quality (and also file size, so beware loading on limited data plans). Before getting there, we had to walk up a long path and decided to get lunch. We both got yuba, which is similar to tofu.

                    We returned to the hotel and relaxed until dinner. Here is what we got.

                <li>We ate breakfast in the hotel room. Our first destination for today was Nijo Castle. This was a showcase of Shogun power before forfeiting it to the emporer. It is over 400 years old.</li>
                <li>
                    This is the first entry way onto the property. The entire property is surrounded by a moat to protect from enemies.

                    We continued walking in the inside of the building as well, but no pictures were allowed. Once we exited, we continued on two another portion of the property. On the map, this part is the area with a second moat surrounding it.

                    This was a super beautiful and well-maintained property. Here are some more pictures.

                    After Noji Castle, our next stop was Tenryu-Ji Temple, which is a property designed into the surrounding nature. It is very intentionally designed for beauty. Here are pictures:
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/tenryuji1.JPG" alt="Tenryu-Ji Temple Image" class="scaled-image">

                    </div>
                    It is important to note, not just for Tenryu-Ji Temple but for all these places, that it is Winter, so it is even more beautiful in the Spring or Summer when cherry blossoms, and other trees and plants are in full bloom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The last place we visited today was the Katsura Imperial Villa which was a property built for the imperial family. It required ID and verification to even enter and was heavily organized compared to other places we visited. It is a beautiful property and we were given a guided tour of it.

                    I think the most interesting thing was how the stone pathways are designed. The stones are placed vertically with a gravel layer below and filled with sediment. The path ends up being roughly 8 inches into the ground which makes it super sturdy and structured very well.

                    We ate breakfast in the hotel, and left Kyoto for Nara. Once we arrived in Nara, we dropped off our luggage at our hotel and headed to the Horyuji Temple which is the oldest standing wooden structures in Japan and maybe the world. This is what we saw from the bus station to the temple.

                    We then returned back to the hotel to rest for a bit. Then we went to park in Nara with the deer. It was dark and late, though, so we didn't see many. Here are some photos I got on our stroll.

                    We ate dinner at a restaurant in the train station. It had unlimited rice and tea refills. The rice came out of a machine -- it was pretty cool.

                        We ate breakfast in the hotel room once again, and our first stop today was Yukishi-ji Temple. Here are some pictures.

                        Next, we walked to the Toshodai-ji Temple. Here are some pictures of the temple and the property.

                        Right across the street from our bus station, we saw a Museum of Folk Life and Traditional Japanese Farmhouse. Due to the intended purpose of this entire project, it was a must see. Here are some of the things we saw.

                        We took the bus to Nara Park with the deer. Here are some deer.

                        The main purpose of coming here, of course, was to see Todai-ji which is the biggest wooden structure in the world. Here are some pictures.

                    <li>
                        We also continued to walk around the large area surrounding Todai-Ji which even includes another world heritage site.

                        Note: I did not write the computer science one, but I do resonate with it.

                        After this we returned to the hotel and relaxed until dinner where we ate at the same restaurant as yesterday. Here is what we got:
